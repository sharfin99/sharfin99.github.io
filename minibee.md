## MiniBEE: A New Form Factor for Compact Bimanual Dexterity

Bimanual robot manipulators can achieve impressive dexterity, but typically rely on two full six- or sevendegree-of-freedom arms so that paired grippers can coordinate
effectively. This traditional framework increases system complexity while only exploiting a fraction of the overall workspace
for dexterous interaction. We introduce the MiniBEE (Miniature Bimanual End-effector), a compact system in which two
reduced-mobility arms (3+ DOF each) are coupled into a kinematic chain that preserves full relative positioning between grippers.
