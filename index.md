## About Me

Hello! My name is Sharfin and I am a fifth year doctoral student at Columbia University studying robotics. I am advised by Matei Ciocarlie and work enabling more capable robots through thoughtful, intelligent hardware design. Before my PhD, I worked on design of minimally actuated quasi-passive walkers with Aaron Johnson, Sarah Bergbreiter, and Justin Yim. 
<br><br/>
Overall, I am interested in the design and control of intelligent, but simple mechanisms that can be deployed in real robotic applications. I enjoy working across the entire spectrum of robotics and automation, where I can leverage my expertise in mechanism design in a full-stack robotic application.

## Projects

[MiniBEE, a novel platform for bi-manual robotic dexterity](minibee.md)<br/>
We introduce MiniBEE, which is a miniature bi-manual end-effector for compact robotic dexterity. MiniBEE takes a new approach to bi-manual dexterity.

[Low-Cost 6-Axis Force/Torque Sensor for Robot Hands](ft6.md)<br/>
A novel method for six-axis force/torque sensing that allows for finger-size packaging with no amplification electronics, low cost manufacturing, and easy integration into a complete hand.

[Multi-Flexor Tendon Transmission Design, Modelling, and Co-Optimization](coop.md)<br/>
We first formulate a general model for an underactuated, tendon-driven transmission and then use this model to co-optimize a three-link, two-actuator kinematic chain using reinforcement learning.

[Miniature Minimally Actuated Quasi-Passive Walker](walker.md)<br/>
By leveraging the passive 3D dynamics, carefully designing the spherical feet, and changing the actuation scheme, we are able to produce a very simple 3D bipedal walking model that has a total of 5 rigid bodies and a single actuator per leg.
